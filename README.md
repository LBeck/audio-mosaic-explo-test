# audio-mosaic-explo-test

TO DO: figure out how to turn each part of the mosaic into a mini slideshow with 4-5 images instead of just two. 

BUGS: the pages work on Chrome, but not Firefox -- I think the querySelector expression to get the image template doesn't work in Firefox (ver 36.0.1 on Linux).
